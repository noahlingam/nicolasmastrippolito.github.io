									<p>In my final year of my studies I conducted my Honors project. It was titled "Performance Evaluation of the iPhone 13 for Outdoor LiDAR and Photogrammetric data collection and processing." The aim of the project was to find out if the iPhone could use its built in LiDAR sensor 
								       to create a point cloud that could be comparable to one produced on a multi-station. The results of my project indicated that the iPhone could produce 3D models to a reletive accuracy of approximetly 30cm, 
									   which is not comparable to a multistation. </p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I currently have a part time role at Coles Moonee Ponds in the fresh produce department. This is a special store as it received a massive renovation in 2020. I was asked to transfer to the store as the fresh produce second in charge before the renovations commenced. 
									   I was responsible for helping lead a small team to complete our day to day tasks whilst having to adapt to the construction that was happening around us. Since the renovations have been completed this store is a brand new concept store for Coles, demonstrating 
									   all of the new inovations coles has for the supermarket industry.
